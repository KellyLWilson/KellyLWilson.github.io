  <h2> Pre-Work Week #4 </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>  What was one thing you liked and disliked about each of the new topics covered in prework? </li>
          <ol>  
            <li> HTML - Looking back now, I ADORE how simple it is.  In the same respect, I dislike how simple it is becasue it is easy to overlook "small" mistakes. </li>
            <li> CSS - I really like how CSS makes everything look better.  It's easy to make your site look "pretty" with code.  I dislike having to figure out "why" when one element overrides another. </li>
            <li> JavaScript - ARGH!!!!! JavaScript is amazing! There is <em>SO</em> much you can do with it.  However, it is simply overwhelming to learn and it makes me doubt myself with every...single...line...of...code!!! </li>
          </ol>   
    <li>  What was helpful? Justin, Ian, the documentation provided, Eloquent JavaScript, my classmates / the help channel, and good old fashioned, "don't give up!"</li>
    <li>  What hindered your progress? Handsdown, myself. I have a tendancy to overcomplicate things. </li>
    <li>  How did you overcome challenges? I worked and worked and worked, and when that didn't help, I reached out to both my classmates and to Justin and Ian.</li>
  
  
  <h2> Pre-Work Week #3 </h2>
  <ol>
    <li> What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?  I can easily see how they all work together, to make pages run smoother, look better, and do amazing things in the background.  I am still completely and totally overwhelemed with javascript.  There is SO much to learn, so much to take in, to not just remember but to disect and understand what eachh piece does.  I find myself constantly looking back at the documentation, trying to understand, bit by bit, how each piece fits together to work.</li>
    <li> What are some objects that your blog incorporates? I wanted to ask someone that enter's my blog, "What is the weather like?" and when they clicked a button it would display a picture of that type of weather.  I am <em>SO EXCITED</em> that I got it to work.  I still need to do some work on it.  I did it in seperate functions and I KNOW it should be done in an array, however, I am really pleased that my idea worked out!!!</li> 
  
  
  
  
  
  <h2> Pre-Work Week #2 </h2>
  <ol>
    <li> What are your thoughts on pseudo coding? Pseudo coding makes logical sense to me.  You have to know your destination before you can begin your journey.  To me, it's a roadmap to your code, which makes coding easier. </li>
    <li> What are you struggling with? I'm still struggling with myself and information overload. </li>
    <li> What are you excited or eager to learn more about?Week #1 Looking back on this week seems to be a blur of information. I'm somewhere between feeling like I have an overload of terms to remember and knowing that I've learning nothing near what I will in the coming weeks! I think I'm going to need to dust off my mental filing cabinet so it has more room for terminology and new ideas. I'm genuinely excited to move forward and see what the next few weeks have to offer. </li>
  </ol>  
  
  <h2> Pre-Work Week #1 </h2>

  <ol>
  <li> Was your first week what you expected? I went into this with an open mind and no clear expectations except to learn, and I'm ceartinly doing that!</li>
  <li> What are you struggling with? Being overwhelmed with information!!! </li>
  <li> What are you excited or eager to learn more about? At this point, I don't even know what I don't know, so I'm excited to learn everything. </li>
  </ol>

  <p> I have found my own fear to be my biggest obstacle this week. To paraphrase the quote by Franklin D. Roosevelt, I sincerely feel, "I have nothing to fear but fear itself." I seemed to have a smoother time of things when I just embraced the lessons and made sure I didn't stand in my own way! </p>
