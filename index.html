  <h2> Week #2 </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> What are your thoughts on pseudo coding? Pseudo coding makes logical sense to me.  You have to know your destination before you can begin your journey.  To me, it's a roadmap to your code, which makes coding easier. </li>
    <li> What are you struggling with? I'm still struggling with myself and information overload. </li>
    <li> What are you excited or eager to learn more about?Week #1 Looking back on this week seems to be a blur of information. I'm somewhere between feeling like I have an overload of terms to remember and knowing that I've learning nothing near what I will in the coming weeks! I think I'm going to need to dust off my mental filing cabinet so it has more room for terminology and new ideas. I'm genuinely excited to move forward and see what the next few weeks have to offer. </li>
  
  <h2> Week #1 </h2>

  <ul>
  <li> Was your first week what you expected? I went into this with an open mind and no clear expectations except to learn, and I'm ceartinly doing that!</li>
  <li> What are you struggling with? Being overwhelmed with information!!! </li>
  <li> What are you excited or eager to learn more about? At this point, I don't even know what I don't know, so I'm excited to learn everything. </li>
  </ul>

  <p> I have found my own fear to be my biggest obstacle this week. To paraphrase the quote by Franklin D. Roosevelt, I sincerely feel, "I have nothing to fear but fear itself." I seemed to have a smoother time of things when I just embraced the lessons and made sure I didn't stand in my own way! </p>
